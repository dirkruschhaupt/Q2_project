Q2 project 2018

A site that is basically a friend tracker. I always forget personal info of friends or how I know them or how we meet. The site would store basic info photo, name, phone number, date meet, place meet, setting, birthday, note, and rank (1-10 rank of importance to you). User would be able to add, edit, view, delete friends. Use Google api to bring up map location. Using ejs, node.js, javascript, css, html, would like to include a log in but thats if time allows.

The project i would estimate to be 60% done. Many struggles came up trough the process of working on this project. A login page was made along with a working database. Working with bootsrtrap had many challenges that was not expected to the point I feel it would have been easier to build all the CSS myself. However the learning experience with bootstrap was the point of the assignment. Ejs proved to be the biggest hurdle in the project, getting the routes to work with the server was a fun challenge and learning experience. I wish we had a few extra days to work on this project to fully understand and figure out ejs to make this more of a fully functional program.
