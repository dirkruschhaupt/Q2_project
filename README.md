Q2 project 2018

A site that is basically a friend tracker. I always forget personal info of friends or how I know them or how we meet. The site would store basic info photo, name, phone number, date meet, place meet, setting, birthday, note, and rank (1-10 rank of importance to you). User would be able to add, edit, view, delete friends. Use Google api to bring up map location. Using ejs, node.js, javascript, css, html, would like to include a log in but thats if time allows.
