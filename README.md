Q2 project 2018

A site that is basically a friend tracker. I always forget personal info of friends or how I know them or how we meet. The site would store basic info photo, name, phone number, date meet, place meet, setting, birthday, note, and rank (1-10 rank of importance to you). User would be able to add, edit, view, delete friends. Use Google api to bring up map location. Using ejs, node.js, javascript, css, html, would like to include a log in but thats if time allows.

User will be able to login and view friends they have entered and view data on individual friends. User will be able to edit information on individual friends, delete friends if they have come to hate them, find the location of friends home if an address has been entered, rank there friend by level of personal importance to them, user will be able to add notes or important events that has happened with this friend. friends will be able to be linked if the are related to one another.
